# ImageBatchRename
This tool should help me clean up me automatic uploads of my smartphone to my cloud service

#Open Issues:
* refactor me nicely
 * show simple progress in non-verbose mode (e.g. dots)
* collect statistics (files moved, errors, ...)
* write some tests
* write at least one lambda statement!
* Can this be done with only one instream per file?
